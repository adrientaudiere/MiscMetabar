  abstract = {Microorganisms play essential roles in the health and resilience of cnidarians. Understanding the factors influencing cnidarian microbiomes requires cross study comparisons, yet the plethora of protocols used hampers dataset integration. Our objective was to unify 16S rRNA gene sequences from cnidarian microbiome studies under a single analysis pipeline. We reprocessed 12,010 cnidarian microbiome samples from 186 studies, alongside 4,002 poriferan, cultured Symbiodiniaceae, and environmental samples, unifying ~6.5 billion sequence reads. This meta-analysis uncovered an incredible diversity of 86 archaeal and bacterial phyla. Globally, cnidarian microbial composition, richness, diversity, and structure are primarily influenced by host phylogeny, sampling depth, and ocean body. Host phylogeny and sampling depth also influenced the Cnidaria 'core microbiome'. We identified host and geographical generalist and specific Endozoicomonas clades within Cnidaria and Porifera. This meta-analysis forms a framework for understanding factors governing cnidarian microbiomes, creating a baseline to help elucidate the impact of stress associated dysbiosis.},

  abstract = {BackgroundIncreasing demand for high-value fish species and pressure on forage fish is challenging aquaculture to ensure sustainable growth by replacing protein sources in aquafeeds with plant and terrestrial animal proteins, without compromising the economic value and quality of the final fish product. In the present study, the effects of a plant protein-based diet (CV), two plant-based diets in which graded amounts of plan protein mixtures were replaced with Hermetia illucens meal alone (VH10) or in combination with poultry by-product meal (PBM) (VH10P30), a fishmeal (FM) diet (CF) and an FM diet supplemented with H. illucens (FH10) on growth performance, gut health and homeostasis of farmed subadult European seabass were tested and compared.ResultsFish fed the VH10 and VH10P30 diets showed the highest specific growth rates and lowest feed conversion ratios among the tested groups. Expectedly, the best preservation of PI morphology was observed in fish fed the CF or FH10 diets, while fish fed the CV diet exhibited significant degenerative changes in the proximal and distal intestines. However, PBM supplementation mitigated these effects and significantly improved all gut morphometric parameters in the VH10P30 group. Partial substitution of the plant mixture with insect meal alone or PBM also induced most BBM genes and activated BBM enzymes, suggesting a beneficial effect on intestinal digestive/absorption functions. Regarding intestinal microbiota, fish fed diets containing H. illucens meal (FH10, VH10, VH10P30) had the highest richness of bacterial communities and abundance of beneficial genera such as Lactobacillus and Bacillus. On the other hand, fish fed CV had the highest microbial diversity but lost a significant component of fish intestinal microbiota, the phylum Bacteroidetes. Finally, skin pigmentation most similar to that of farmed or even wild seabass was also observed in the fish groups fed CF, FH10 or VH10P30.ConclusionPlant-based diets supplemented with PBM and H. illucens pupae meal have great potential as alternative diets for European seabass, without affecting growth performance, gut homeostasis, or overall fitness. This also highlights the importance of animal proteins in diets of European seabass, as the addition of a small amount of these alternative animal protein sources significantly improved all measured parameters.},

  abstract = {Different from other fungal species that can be largely cultivated in 'axenic conditions' using plant material (e.g., species of Lentinula and Pleurotus in 'sterile' straw-based substrate), the commercial Agaricus bisporus cultivation system relies heavily on ecological relationships with a broad range of microorganisms present in the system (compost and casing). Since the A. bisporus cultivation system consists of a microbial manipulation process, it is important to know the microbial community dynamics during the entire cultivation cycle to design further studies and/or crop management strategies to optimize this system. To capture the bacterial community 'flow' from compost raw materials to the casing to the formation and maturation of mushroom caps, community snapshots were generated by direct DNA recovery (amplicon sequencing). The 'bacterial community flow' revealed that compost, casing and mushrooms represent different niches for bacteria present in the cultivation system, but at the same time, a bacterial exchange between microenvironments can occur for a portion of the community. Within each microenvironment, compost showed intense bacterial populational dynamics, probably due to the environmental changes imposed by composting conditions. In casing, the colonization of A. bisporus appeared, to reshape the native bacterial community which later, with some other members present in compost, becomes the core community in mushroom caps. The current bacterial survey along with previous results provides more cues of specific bacteria groups that can be in association with A. bisporus development and health.},
