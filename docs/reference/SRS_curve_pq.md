# Scaling with ranked subsampling (SRS) curve of phyloseq object

[![lifecycle-experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/lifecycle-experimental-orange)](https://adrientaudiere.github.io/MiscMetabar/articles/Rules.html#lifecycle)

A wraper of
[`SRS::SRScurve()`](https://rdrr.io/pkg/SRS/man/SRScurve.html) function.

## Usage

``` r
SRS_curve_pq(physeq, clean_pq = FALSE, ...)
```

## Arguments

- physeq:

  (required) a
  [`phyloseq-class`](https://rdrr.io/pkg/phyloseq/man/phyloseq-class.html)
  object obtained using the `phyloseq` package.

- clean_pq:

  (logical): Does the phyloseq object is cleaned using the
  [`clean_pq()`](https://adrientaudiere.github.io/MiscMetabar/reference/clean_pq.md)
  function?

- ...:

  Additional arguments passed on to
  [`SRS::SRScurve()`](https://rdrr.io/pkg/SRS/man/SRScurve.html)

## Value

A plot

## Examples

``` r
if (requireNamespace("SRS")) {
  SRS_curve_pq(data_fungi_mini,
    max.sample.size = 200,
    rarefy.comparison = TRUE, rarefy.repeats = 3
  )
  SRS_curve_pq(data_fungi_mini, max.sample.size = 500, metric = "shannon")
