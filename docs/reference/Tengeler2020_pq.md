## Usage

``` r
data(Tengeler2020_pq)
```

## Format

A phyloseq object

## Details

Tengeler2020 includes gut microbiota profiles of 27 persons with ADHD. A
standard bioinformatic and statistical analysis done to demonstrate that
altered microbial composition could be a driver of altered brain
structure and function and concomitant changes in the animals behavior.
This was investigated by colonizing young, male, germ-free
C57BL/6JOlaHsd mice with microbiota from individuals with and without
ADHD.
