\title{Subset taxa using a taxa control (e.g. truffle root tips) through 3 methods.}
\usage{
subset_taxa_tax_control(
  physeq,
  taxa_distri,
  method = "mean",
  min_diff_for_cutoff
)
}
\arguments{
\item{physeq}{(required) a \code{\link{phyloseq-class}} object.}

\item{taxa_distri}{(required) a vector of length equal to the number of
samples with the number of sequences per samples for the taxa control}

\item{method}{(default: "mean") a method to calculate the cut-off value.
There is 6 available methods:
\enumerate{
\item \code{cutoff_seq}: discard taxa with less than the number of sequence
than taxa control,
\item \code{cutoff_mixt}: using mixture models,
\item \code{cutoff_diff}: using a minimum difference threshold
(need the argument min_diff_for_cutoff)
\item \code{min}: the minimum of the three firsts methods
\item \code{max}: the maximum of the three firsts methods
\item \code{mean}: the mean of the three firsts methods
}}

\item{min_diff_for_cutoff}{(int) argument for method \code{cutoff_diff}.
Required if method is \code{cutoff_diff}, \code{min}, \code{max} or \code{min}}
}
\value{
A new \code{\link{phyloseq-class}} object.
}
