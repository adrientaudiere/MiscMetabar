\title{Plot taxonomic distribution across 3 taxonomic levels and optionally
one sample factor}
\usage{
multitax_bar_pq(
  physeq,
  lvl1,
  lvl2,
  lvl3,
  fact = NULL,
  nb_seq = TRUE,
  log10trans = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{physeq}{(required): a \code{\link{phyloseq-class}} object obtained
using the \code{phyloseq} package.}

\item{lvl1}{(required) Name of the first (higher) taxonomic rank of interest}

\item{lvl2}{(required) Name of the second (middle) taxonomic rank of interest}

\item{lvl3}{(required) Name of the first (lower) taxonomic rank of interest}

\item{fact}{Name of the factor to cluster samples by modalities.
Need to be in \code{physeq@sam_data}. If not set, the taxonomic
distribution is plot for all samples together.}

\item{nb_seq}{(logical; default TRUE) If set to FALSE, only the number of ASV
is count. Concretely, physeq otu_table is transformed in a binary
otu_table (each value different from zero is set to one)}

\item{log10trans}{(logical, default TRUE) If TRUE,
the number of sequences (or ASV if nb_seq = FALSE) is log10
transformed.}
}
\value{
A ggplot2 graphic
}

\ifelse{html}{\href{https://lifecycle.r-lib.org/articles/stages.html#experimental}{\figure{lifecycle-experimental.svg}{options: alt='[Experimental]'}}}{\strong{[Experimental]}}

Note that lvl3 need to be nested in lvl2 which need to be nested
in lvl1
