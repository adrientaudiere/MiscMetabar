\title{Plot OTU circle for \code{\link{phyloseq-class}} object}
\usage{
otu_circle(
  physeq = NULL,
  fact = NULL,
  taxa = "Order",
  nb_seq = TRUE,
  rarefy = FALSE,
  min_prop_tax = 0.01,
  min_prop_mod = 0.1,
  gap_degree = NULL,
  start_degree = NULL,
  row_col = NULL,
  grid_col = NULL,
  log10trans = F,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{physeq}{(required): a \code{\link{phyloseq-class}} object.}

\item{fact}{(required): Name of the factor to cluster samples by modalities.
Need to be in \code{physeq@sam_data}.}

\item{taxa}{(Default:'Order'): Name of the taxonomic rank of interest}

\item{nb_seq}{(Default: TRUE): Represent the number of sequences or the
number of OTUs (nb_seq = FALSE)}

\item{rarefy}{(logical): Does each samples modalities need to be rarefy in
order to compare them with the same amount of sequences?}

\item{min_prop_tax}{(Default: 0.01): The minimum proportion for taxon to be
ploted}

\item{min_prop_mod}{(Default: 0.1) : The minimum proportion for modalities
to be ploted}

\item{gap_degree}{: Gap between two neighbour sectors.
It can be a single value or a vector. If it is a vector,
 the first value corresponds to the gap after the first
 sector.}

\item{start_degree}{: The starting degree from which the circle begins to
draw. Note this degree is measured in the standard polar coordinate
which means it is always reverse-clockwise.}

\item{row_col}{: Color vector for row}

\item{grid_col}{: Grid colors which correspond to sectors. The length of the
vector should be either 1 or the number of sectors.
It's preferred that grid_col is a named vector of which names
correspond to sectors. If it is not a named vector, the
order of grid_col corresponds to order of sectors.}

\item{log10trans}{(logical): Should sequence be log10 transformed
(more precisely by log10(1+x))?}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed on to

}
\value{
A \code{\link[circlize]{chordDiagram}} plot representing the
  distribution of OTUs or sequences in the different modalities of the factor
  fact
