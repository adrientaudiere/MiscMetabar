abstract = {Abstract Environmental DNA metabarcoding is a powerful tool for studying biodiversity. However, bioinformatic approaches need to adjust to the diversity of taxonomic compartments targeted as well as to each barcode gene specificities. We built and tested a pipeline based on read correction with DADA2 allowing analysing metabarcoding data from prokaryotic (16S) and eukaryotic (18S, COI) life compartments. We implemented the option to cluster amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) into operational taxonomic units (OTUs) with swarm, a network-based clustering algorithm, and the option to curate ASVs/OTUs using LULU. Finally, taxonomic assignment was implemented via the Ribosomal Database Project Bayesian classifier (RDP) and BLAST. We validated this pipeline with ribosomal and mitochondrial markers using metazoan mock communities and 42 deep-sea sediment samples. The results show that ASVs and OTUs describe different levels of biotic diversity, the choice of which depends on the research questions. They underline the advantages and complementarity of clustering and LULU-curation for producing metazoan biodiversity inventories at a level approaching the one obtained using morphological criteria. While clustering removes intraspecific variation, LULU effectively removes spurious clusters, originating from errors or intragenomic variability. Swarm clustering affected alpha and beta diversity differently depending on genetic marker. Specifically, d-values > 1 appeared to be less appropriate with 18S for metazoans. Similarly, increasing LULU’s minimum ratio level proved essential to avoid losing species in sample-poor data sets. Comparing BLAST and RDP underlined that accurate assignments of deep-sea species can be obtained with RDP, but highlighted the need for a concerted effort to build comprehensive, ecosystem-specific databases.},

However, the role of microdiversity in the stability of whole microbial communities remains underexplored. Understanding the drivers of microbial community stability is necessary to predict community response to future disturbances. Here, we analyzed 16S rRNA gene amplicons from eight different temperate bog lakes at the 97\\% OTU and amplicon sequence variant (ASV) levels and found ecotypes within the same OTU with different distribution patterns in space and time. We observed that these ecotypes are adapted to different values of environmental factors such as water temperature and oxygen concentration. Our results showed that the existence of several ASVs within a OTU favored its persistence across changing environmental conditions. We propose that microdiversity aids the stability of microbial communities in the face of fluctuations in environmental factors.}",

After conducting the initial bioinformatic analysis of amplicon sequencing data, performing the subsequent statistics and data mining based on the operational taxonomic unit and taxonomic assignment tables is still complicated and time-consuming. To address this problem, we present an integrated R package-'microeco' as an analysis pipeline for treating microbial community and environmental data. This package was developed based on the R6 class system and combines a series of commonly used and advanced approaches in microbial community ecology research. The package includes classes for data preprocessing, taxa abundance plotting, venn diagram, alpha diversity analysis, beta diversity analysis, differential abundance test and indicator taxon analysis, environmental data analysis, null model analysis, network analysis and functional analysis. Each class is designed to provide a set of approaches that can be easily accessible to users. Compared with other R packages in the microbial ecology field, the microeco package is fast, flexible and modularized to use and provides powerful and convenient tools for researchers. The microeco package can be installed from CRAN (The Comprehensive R Archive Network) or github (https://github.com/ChiLiubio/microeco).}},

Here we introduce MicrobiomeAnalyst 2.0 to support comprehensive statistics, visualization, functional interpretation, and integrative analysis of data outputs commonly generated from microbiome studies. Compared to the previous version, MicrobiomeAnalyst 2.0 features three new modules: (i) a Raw Data Processing module for amplicon data processing and taxonomy annotation that connects directly with the Marker Data Profiling module for downstream statistical analysis; (ii) a Microbiome Metabolomics Profiling module to help dissect associations between community compositions and metabolic activities through joint analysis of paired microbiome and metabolomics datasets; and (iii) a Statistical Meta-Analysis module to help identify consistent signatures by integrating datasets across multiple studies. Other important improvements include added support for multi-factor differential analysis and interactive visualizations for popular graphical outputs, updated methods for functional prediction and correlation analysis, and expanded taxon set libraries based on the latest literature. These new features are demonstrated using a multi-omics dataset from a recent type 1 diabetes study. MicrobiomeAnalyst 2.0 is freely available at microbiomeanalyst.ca.}},

Understanding the factors influencing cnidarian microbiomes requires cross study comparisons, yet the plethora of protocols used hampers dataset integration. Our objective was to unify 16S rRNA gene sequences from cnidarian microbiome studies under a single analysis pipeline. We reprocessed 12,010 cnidarian microbiome samples from 186 studies, alongside 4,002 poriferan, cultured Symbiodiniaceae, and environmental samples, unifying ~6.5 billion sequence reads. This meta-analysis uncovered an incredible diversity of 86 archaeal and bacterial phyla. Globally, cnidarian microbial composition, richness, diversity, and structure are primarily influenced by host phylogeny, sampling depth, and ocean body. Host phylogeny and sampling depth also influenced the Cnidaria 'core microbiome'. We identified host and geographical generalist and specific Endozoicomonas clades within Cnidaria and Porifera. This meta-analysis forms a framework for understanding factors governing cnidarian microbiomes, creating a baseline to help elucidate the impact of stress associated dysbiosis.},

  abstract = {BackgroundIncreasing demand for high-value fish species and pressure on forage fish is challenging aquaculture to ensure sustainable growth by replacing protein sources in aquafeeds with plant and terrestrial animal proteins, without compromising the economic value and quality of the final fish product. In the present study, the effects of a plant protein-based diet (CV), two plant-based diets in which graded amounts of plan protein mixtures were replaced with Hermetia illucens meal alone (VH10) or in combination with poultry by-product meal (PBM) (VH10P30), a fishmeal (FM) diet (CF) and an FM diet supplemented with H. illucens (FH10) on growth performance, gut health and homeostasis of farmed subadult European seabass were tested and compared.ResultsFish fed the VH10 and VH10P30 diets showed the highest specific growth rates and lowest feed conversion ratios among the tested groups. Expectedly, the best preservation of PI morphology was observed in fish fed the CF or FH10 diets, while fish fed the CV diet exhibited significant degenerative changes in the proximal and distal intestines. However, PBM supplementation mitigated these effects and significantly improved all gut morphometric parameters in the VH10P30 group. Partial substitution of the plant mixture with insect meal alone or PBM also induced most BBM genes and activated BBM enzymes, suggesting a beneficial effect on intestinal digestive/absorption functions. Regarding intestinal microbiota, fish fed diets containing H. illucens meal (FH10, VH10, VH10P30) had the highest richness of bacterial communities and abundance of beneficial genera such as Lactobacillus and Bacillus. On the other hand, fish fed CV had the highest microbial diversity but lost a significant component of fish intestinal microbiota, the phylum Bacteroidetes. Finally, skin pigmentation most similar to that of farmed or even wild seabass was also observed in the fish groups fed CF, FH10 or VH10P30.ConclusionPlant-based diets supplemented with PBM and H. illucens pupae meal have great potential as alternative diets for European seabass, without affecting growth performance, gut homeostasis, or overall fitness. This also highlights the importance of animal proteins in diets of European seabass, as the addition of a small amount of these alternative animal protein sources significantly improved all measured parameters.},

  abstract = {Different from other fungal species that can be largely cultivated in 'axenic conditions' using plant material (e.g., species of Lentinula and Pleurotus in 'sterile' straw-based substrate), the commercial Agaricus bisporus cultivation system relies heavily on ecological relationships with a broad range of microorganisms present in the system (compost and casing). Since the A. bisporus cultivation system consists of a microbial manipulation process, it is important to know the microbial community dynamics during the entire cultivation cycle to design further studies and/or crop management strategies to optimize this system. To capture the bacterial community 'flow' from compost raw materials to the casing to the formation and maturation of mushroom caps, community snapshots were generated by direct DNA recovery (amplicon sequencing). The 'bacterial community flow' revealed that compost, casing and mushrooms represent different niches for bacteria present in the cultivation system, but at the same time, a bacterial exchange between microenvironments can occur for a portion of the community. Within each microenvironment, compost showed intense bacterial populational dynamics, probably due to the environmental changes imposed by composting conditions. In casing, the colonization of A. bisporus appeared, to reshape the native bacterial community which later, with some other members present in compost, becomes the core community in mushroom caps. The current bacterial survey along with previous results provides more cues of specific bacteria groups that can be in association with A. bisporus development and health.},
